Dataset Source : https://github.com/kennedykwangari/Mall-Customer-Segmentation-Data/blob/master/Mall_Customers.csv


Steps :


1. Load and clean dataset
   
      
2. Data Preprocessing
    - Standardize data --> Done Gender Encoding
    - Determine which scaler technique to apply --> MinMaxScaler
    
    
3. Clustering
    - Applied MinMaxScaler scaler technique 
    - Derived conclusion from 3D scatterplot 
       
           
4. Visualization
    - Created 2D Scatter Plot to represent the clusters with reduced dimensions to two for visualization.
    - Ploted clusters in different colors
    - Ploted Pair Plots to visualize relationships between features within clusters.
    - Prepared Centroid Visuals
